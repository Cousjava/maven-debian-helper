maven-debian-helper (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * mh_make falls back on EMAIL when DEBEMAIL is not set
  * mh_make handles better multi projects
  * mh_make generates projects following the Debian 3.8.3 policy
  * Documentation improvements
  * maven.mk: unpatch the poms in cleanbuilddir, to have a good
    clean sequence when maven.mk is used with a patch system -
    clean target -> mvn clean -> rm tmp files -> unpatch pom files
     -> unpatch files with patch system
  * Read rules from the Maven repository to force the version of
    Maven plugins to be the same as in the repository
  * maven.mk removes some elements from the POM files when their
    use is against the Debian policy (<repositories> as they
    imply downloading artifacts from the Internet, 
    <distributionManagement> as it implies publishing on the net
    or in a location not controlled by Debian) or when they are
    not needed and risk pulling out unwanted dependencies
    (<reports> which is not used if a documentation package is
    not generated)
  * maven.mk adds a patch to Maven to disable using the
    maven-site-plugin when no documentation package is generated.
    This helps to reduce the amount of build dependencies

  * Add apt-file to Recommends: as it's used by mh_lspoms
    (Closes: #542511)

  [Michael Koch]

maven-debian-helper (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update everything to version 0.6 because 2 scripts have still been at
    version 0.4. We should make the package more version agnostic.

maven-debian-helper (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update Standards-Version to 3.8.2

maven-debian-helper (0.4) experimental; urgency=low

  [Ludovic Claude]
  * Add myself to Uploaders
  * Use maven-ant-helper for the build instead of recursively building
    this package with itself (which required an ugly bootstrap script)
  * Integrate the cdbs helper with maven-repo-helper, this unifies the
    way the Maven repository is used, and simplifies the job of the
    packager as maven-repo-helper takes care of most POM patching work.
  * Use default-jdk for the build
  * Change section to java, update Standards-Version to 3.8.1
  * Generate Javadoc API automatically.
  * Add mh_make tool to generate Debian packaging automatically from
    a Maven project.
    
  [Torsten Werner]
  * Implement pom faking.
